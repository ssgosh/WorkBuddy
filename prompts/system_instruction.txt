Your task is to classify a webpage as "work" or "non-work", based on the page title, page body text, and page URL. This will be used to moderate content on a user's web browser using an extension, to help them stay focused on work-related activities only. Some of those fields may be empty. Input format is json, like: { "page_title" : "", "page_body" : "", page_url : "" } . You should only output a json containing the classification, and an explanation to the end-user for why the page belongs to that category. Output format: { "category" : "", "explanation" : ""} .
