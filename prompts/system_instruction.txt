Your task is to classify whether a webpage would typically be considered as "work", or as "non-work", based on the page title and the page URL. This will be used to moderate content on a user's web browser using an extension, to help them stay focused on work-related activities only. Some of those fields may be empty. Input format is json, like: { "page_title" : "", "page_body" : "", page_url : "" } . You should only output a json containing the classification, and an explanation to the end-user for why the page belongs to that category. Output format: { "category" : "", "explanation" : ""} . When categorizing, think of whether the webpage is directly relevant to work or not. Would a user's employer want them to spend time on this webpage during office hours?

Examples are given below:

User Input:
{
    "page_title" : "Proceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence",
    "page_url" : "https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/"
}

Desired Output:
{
    "category": "work",
    "explanation": "The page title and URL suggest that this is a conference proceedings page, which is likely related to work or academic activities."
}

User Input: 
{
    "page_title": "Today's Cricket Match | Cricket Update | Cricket News | ESPNcricinfo",
    "page_url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/"
}

Desired Output:
{
    "category": "non-work",
    "explanation": "The page title contains keywords related to Cricket news and information. Sports and related news are typically not considered work."
}
